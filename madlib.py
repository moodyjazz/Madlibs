madlib = f"My name is {proper_noun1}. I love playing League of Legends even when it is so {neg_adj1}. \
My {body_part} {neg_verb1} because of the {adj_1} amount of hours I put into this {adj_2} game. {Exclamation}! \
This is such a {role} diff. This {neg_adj2} player literally fed our mid-lane like a {animal} that is \
{verb_ends_with_ing} a big {fruit1}. If only {important_historical_figure} {past_tense_verb} from the heavens, \
only they would be able to save this {extremely_neg_adj} game. I am filled with so much {emotion} that I \
cannot {verb1} my {random_proper_noun} and now I have to shovel my {random_proper_noun2}. We should just \
surrender before the {weather} comes and makes me {verb2} down and cry myself to sleep."
